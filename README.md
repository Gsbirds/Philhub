# Philhub

I think we should make education as free and accessible as possible. A huge problem I had during my time in academia was the
fact that papers that should be in the public domain (written by people like Descartes and Hume) were, in fact, not so easy to access or not free 
if they were. I wanted to provide a place that made Philosophy free... again. My ultimate goal is also for people to upload their own works and to 
be able to collaborate and build a community that helps them learn, grow, and be better philosophers who write better papers. In this way, they will 
also be able to give back. You should not have to pay for college to be able to be a philosopher- this is antithetical to what a philosopher is.
